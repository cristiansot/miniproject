Now, create a testCurrency model, it will be almost exactly the same as the Currency model, but we neither want a countryId attribute anymore, nor a reference to the Country table, also the modelName attribute is 'testCurrency' instead of 'Currency'. We are doing this to make the tests a bit simpler, as we won't have a reference to another table, since we want to test the Currencies independently.
